Tools Used:
Excel
SSMS
T-SQL

Dataset has information regarding COVID-19 cases starting from January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2021 such as
total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total vaccinations, and population.

Excel Transformations:
Move Population data from end of the sheet next to total_cases and new_cases columns.
Delete irrelevant data for analysis from sheet by using shortcut "CTL + SHIFT + Right Arrow Key"

Moved data from covid spreadsheet dataset into separate CovidVaccinations and CovidDeaths spreadsheet datasets.

Used the 2022 SQL Server Import and Export wizard to import data from Excel spreadsheets into SQL Server Database:
-- The source was Microsoft Excel
-- The destination was OLEDB Provider for SQL Server

Troubleshooting:
Required Microsoft Access Database Engine to be installed to use wizard.
Also required integration services to be installed.
CAST function was required for analysis because some numeric data was uploaded as NVARCHAR.
