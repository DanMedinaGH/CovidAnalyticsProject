# Overview
This repository contains files for the COVID data analytics guided project I followed <br/>
created by Alex the Analyst 

The end-to-end project contains four sub-projects on SQL EDA, Tableau, SQL Cleaning, and Python analysis.<br/>

First video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to see how a professional would conduct an end-to-end project, <br/>
show my understanding, and to help myself create personal projects in the future.

# Additional Info
Each sub-project will contain separate README. Please read for insights I learned for each one.
